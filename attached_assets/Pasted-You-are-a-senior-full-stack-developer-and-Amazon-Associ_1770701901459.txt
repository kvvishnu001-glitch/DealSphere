You are a senior full-stack developer and Amazon Associates Program compliance auditor.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
An existing Deals & Coupons website and application is already built in this Replit project.
Your task is NOT to rebuild the app, but to AUDIT, CORRECT, and UPDATE the existing codebase so it is fully compliant with Amazon Associates Program Operating Agreement and Policies:
https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/operating/policies

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
Ensure 100% compliance with Amazon affiliate policies.
Compliance takes priority over features, design, SEO, or monetization.

STEP 1: COMPLIANCE AUDIT
Review the entire existing project, including:
- Frontend UI
- Backend logic
- Affiliate links
- Content wording
- Data handling
- App behavior (web & mobile if applicable)

Identify:
- Policy violations
- Gray areas
- Missing required elements
- Risky wording or UX patterns

STEP 2: REQUIRED AMAZON COMPLIANCE RULES
Ensure the project strictly follows these rules:

AFFILIATE LINKS & CONTENT:
- No hardcoded Amazon product prices
- No fake discounts or misleading savings claims
- No claims like “best price,” “cheapest,” or “lowest price guaranteed”
- No copying Amazon product titles or descriptions verbatim
- No manipulation, cloaking, or shortening of Amazon affiliate links
- No auto-redirects or forced clicks
- No incentivized clicks (no rewards, points, or misleading CTAs)

PRICING & DATA:
- Only show prices or availability if fetched dynamically via Amazon Product Advertising API
- If PA API is not used, REMOVE all prices completely
- Auto-expire or clearly mark invalid or outdated deals

DISCLOSURES (MANDATORY):
- Add the disclosure:
  “As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases.”
- Disclosure must be:
  - Clearly visible
  - Human-readable
  - Present on all pages containing Amazon affiliate links
- Add a dedicated Affiliate Disclosure page if missing

TRADEMARK & BRAND USAGE:
- Do NOT use Amazon logos, badges, or trademarks unless explicitly allowed
- Do NOT imply partnership, sponsorship, or endorsement by Amazon

APP-SPECIFIC RULES:
- No affiliate links in emails, push notifications, PDFs, or offline formats
- Ensure mobile app behavior complies with Amazon’s mobile policies

STEP 3: FIX & IMPLEMENT
For every issue found:
- Correct the code or content
- Remove features that cannot be made compliant
- Add missing disclosures, timestamps, or safeguards
- Comment the code explaining compliance-related changes

STEP 4: FINAL VERIFICATION
Before finishing:
- Re-review the entire app as if you are Amazon’s compliance review team
- Confirm there are ZERO violations or risky gray areas
- If any feature risks suspension, disable or redesign it

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- List all issues found (with file names)
- Explain what was changed and why
- Confirm compliance rule-by-rule
- Highlight any areas requiring ongoing manual review
- State clearly whether the project is now Amazon Associates compliant

FINAL RULE:
If a feature conflicts with Amazon policy, REMOVE it rather than risk violation.
