# Overview

DealSphere is an AI-powered deals and coupons platform that aggregates product deals from various stores and uses artificial intelligence to validate and categorize them. The platform now features a public-facing deals browser that shows all deal types (top deals, hot deals, latest deals) without requiring authentication, and an admin dashboard for managing deal submissions, approvals, and analytics. Built as a full-stack application with React frontend and Express backend, it leverages OpenAI for deal validation. A Python backend implementation has also been developed as an alternative.
